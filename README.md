üîä BlockBeats allows all players to upload their own music and sounds to the server in real time and play them for all players at any time without having to load and update resource packs. It uses the vanilla Sound System, which integrates the mod into the game as well as possible. BlockBeats is a complete rewrite of the discontinued [Mineify Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mineify).

üß© This mod requires [DragNSounds API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dragnsounds-api) to be installed to function. DragNSounds is based on [DragonLib 2](https://github.com/MisterJulsen/MC-DragonLib2) and [Architectury API](https://docs.architectury.dev/) and uses [JAVE2](https://github.com/a-schild/jave2) for audio management. Read more about DragNSounds API in its [documentation](https://misterjulsen.github.io/DragNSounds-API).
